ASTEROIDS GAME USING PYGAME PROGRAMMING PROJECT(PYTHON)

Game programming is quite lucrative these days, and it may also be used for advertising and
education. Game development involves arithmetic, logic, physics, artificial intelligence, and
much more, and it can be a lot of fun. Game development in Python is done with pygame, which
is one of the best modules for doing so.

Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes
computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming
language.

PROGRAM STRUCTURE
Pygame:
In this program, Pygame library is used to display the game on the screen to the user. It is used to move the
objects i.e., images on the screen.
Math:
Math library is used to calculate the cosine and sine functions in order to use them to move the objects in
different directions.
Random:
Random library is used to generate random numbers, where these are used to generate the asteroids in random
directions and spawn the stars, alien-ships randomly during the game.

CONCLUSION:
The game revolves around inputs that the programmer provides. When I was writing the
code, I experimented with different inputs by changing the values and image directions.
It fundamentally alters the nature of the game. When you look at the code, you can see
how changing one input changes the entire game. The entire process of developing a
game, organising files, importing and utilising assets, and coding the logic has been an
eye-opening experience for me that will be beneficial in future projects
